Features
Semantic HTML
Semantic HTML was utilized extensively throughout the project to ensure proper structure and accessibility. By using semantic elements like <header>, <nav>, <main>, <figcaption>, <section>, and <footer>, the document structure becomes more meaningful and understandable, both for developers and assistive technologies.

CSS Animations
CSS animations were implemented to bring life to the images displayed on the PhotoBlog. Animations such as transitions, transforms, and keyframes were used to create engaging effects that capture the user's attention without sacrificing performance.
